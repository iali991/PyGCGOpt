The callbacks of the Python interface match those of the C interface.\n",

    "The above class is already enough to define our detector!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk it through:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the constructor, we compute the powerset based on the number of constraints our model has. Each element of the `conss_powerset` list will be a *set* of constraints to reformulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `propagatePartialdec` method is one of three methods that can be overriden for a detector. It receives two arguments `detprobdata` of type `DetProbData` and `workonpartialdec` of type `PartialDecomposition`. The first argument contains generic information accumulated during the detection and classification process. The second argument contains a partial decomposition that our detector *may* use to derive new (partial) decompositions. In our case, the passed partial decomposition will always be empty due to how we will setup the experiment later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our detector gets all constraints from the partial decomposition and then iterates over the previously generated powerset of constraints. We select the constraints to reformulate and the constraints to remain in the master problem. Then, we copy the partial decomposition and assign the master and reformulation constraints. In the end, we return all new partial decompositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You may wonder why we use a for-loop to iterate over the powerset but exit after one iteration. Down below, we will create a fresh `Model` for *every* decomposition and assign the *same* instance of the detector. GCG will call the `propagatePartialdec` method once for each model and our code will return a different decomposition each time because `conss_powerset` is a Python iterable object. Thus, the iteration will *not* start over but ascend every time.\n",
