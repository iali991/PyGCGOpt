Installation
============

Requirements
------------

PyGCGOpt requires a working installation of the [GCG Solver](https://gcg.or.rwth-aachen.de/). Please, make sure that your GCG installation works!

Note that the latest PyGCGOpt version is usually only compatible with the latest major release of the SCIP Optimization Suite.
The following table summarizes which versions of PyGCGOpt, GCG, PySCIPOpt, and SCIP are compatible:

|SCIP| PySCIPOpt | GCG | PyGCGOpt
|----|----|----|----|
8.0 | 3.4 | 3.5.x | 0.1.0 |
7.0 | 3.x | - | - |
6.0 | 2.x | - | - |
5.0 | 1.4, 1.3 | - | - |
4.0 | 1.2, 1.1 | - | - |
3.2 | 1.0 | - | - |

If SCIP and GCG are not installed in the global path,
you need to specify the install location using the environment variable
`SCIPOPTDIR`:

-   on Linux and OS X:\
    `export SCIPOPTDIR=<path_to_install_dir>`
-   on Windows:\
    `set SCIPOPTDIR=<path_to_install_dir>` (**cmd**, **Cmder**, **WSL**)\
    `$Env:SCIPOPTDIR = "<path_to_install_dir>"` (**powershell**)

`SCIPOPTDIR` needs to have a subdirectory `lib` that contains the
library, e.g. `libscip.so` and `libgcg.so` (for Linux) and a subdirectory `include` that
contains the corresponding header files:

    SCIPOPTDIR
      > lib
        > libscip.so ...
        > libgcg.so ...
      > include
        > scip
        > gcg
        > lpi
        > nlpi
        > ...

If you are not using the installer packages, you need to [install GCG using CMake](https://gcg.or.rwth-aachen.de/doc-preview/doc-3.5.0/install-manually.html).
The Makefile system is not compatible with PyGCGOpt and PySCIPOpt!


Building everything from source
-------------------------------

Recommended is to install in a virtual environment (e.g. `python3 -m venv <DIR_PATH>`).
Please note that a globally installed version of PyGCGOpt on your machine might lead to problems.

After setting up and activating your virtual environment (`source <DIR_PATH>/bin/activate`) make sure you have [Cython](http://cython.org/) installed, at least version 0.21

    pip install cython

Note you will also need the `wheel` package, which usually is already installed:

    pip install wheel

Furthermore, you need to have the Python
development files installed on your system (error message "Python.h not
found"):

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev  # for Python 3, on Linux

If you want to build GCG from source, from the GCG root folder to the following:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSHARED=on -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install -DZIMPL=OFF -DIPOPT=OFF -DPAPILO=OFF
    make && make install

After setting up `SCIPOPTDIR` as specified above install PyGCGOpt

    export SCIPOPTDIR=/path/to/scip/install/dir
    python -m pip install .

For recompiling the source in the current directory `.` use

    python -m pip install --compile .

Building with debug information
-------------------------------

To use debug information in PyGCGOpt you need to build it like this:

    python -m pip install --install-option="--debug" .

Be aware that you will need the **debug library** of the SCIP
Optimization Suite for this to work
(`cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`).

Testing new installation
------------------------

To test your brand-new installation of PyGCGOpt you need
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) on your system.

    pip install pytest

Here is the complete [installation
procedure](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).

Tests can be run in the `PyGCGOpt` directory with: :

    py.test # all the available tests
    py.test tests/test_name.py # a specific tests/test_name.py (Unix)

Ideally, the status of your tests must be passed or skipped. Running
tests with pytest creates the `__pycache__` directory in `tests` and,
occasionally, a `model` file in the working directory. They can be
removed harmlessly.
